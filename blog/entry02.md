# Entry 2: Learning the basis of jQuery and setting up my home page 
##### 12/11/23

### Introduction
The current Engineering Design Process I am on is "research the problem". So now that I have planned to make a fitness app I must research how exactly I am going to create it by going on the search on YouTube and looking for a valuable tutorial that will help guide me with using my tool.
### Learning jQuery
I searched jQuery and then went to where it says "API documentation" then found all of these different types of jQuery function signatures such as Ajax, attributes, events, shorthand methods, DOM, etc. At first glance, this did look overwhelming so I searched "How jQuery Works" and they had this started code when you are using jQuery to set up your HTML page. Then I went to jQuery's learning center and then I went to use jQuery Core where I would learn more about the jQuery keys and commands. With jQuery the page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready" and jQuery can detect whether or not it's ready for you. Like for example code inside $( document ).ready(function() will only run once the page DOM is ready for Javascript code to execute. I copied this code into my js bin where it says javascript, also the reason why I chose to do jsbin first is that it finds it easier to work there like as my draft so I can see how the code will visually play out and then paste it into my side once I am done.
So then I went to Bootstrap and imported the code in the stylesheet href. As well as jQuery cdn.

### Skills
One skill I've developed for this entry is "Problem Decomposition". First I had to create a plan and a vision of how I wanted to make my fitness app/website look. I needed to figure out how to use my tool jQuery and what specific components I needed to use to help me execute the code for this fitness app. And of so I first started with the HTML and got Bootstrap components to give me the base of the fitness app, then I went to the javascript and jQuery code and then CSS to top it off so this is how I envisioned in my head process looking like I code.
Another skill I learned is called the "Growth mindset". An example of how I preserved while coding for this project is that even when my peers said jQuery is hard to work with I took it upon myself to try and learn on my own by watching tutorials going to jQuery and reading the documentation they have and learning the syntax and all the different types of ajax they have as well as also learning DOM manipulation and this was helpful because I wanted to make my fitness app/site interactive for the user to be able to participate and it modifies the HTML elements depending on their tag name, or class id. I also searched for jQuery code examples because I am a more visual learner so I like to see the code and how it's done for myself to get an idea of what to do how to start and placement ideas. I would also set a goal for certain days when I'm not too busy doing something else for this class like when I have the freest time to work on this project or whenever I can squeeze in the time and progress through each time.
