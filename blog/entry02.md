# Entry 2: Learning how to use jQuery to build a fitness app
##### 12/11/23

### Introduction
The current Engineering Design Process i am on is "research the problem". So now that i have planned to make a fitness app i must do research on how exactly i am going to create it by watching going on the search in youtube and looking for a valuable tutorial that will actually help guide me with using my tool.
### Learning jQuery
I searched up jquery and then went to where it says "api documentation" then found all of these different types of jQuery function signatures such as ajax,attributes,events,shorthand methods,DOM, and etc.At first glance this did look overwhelming so i searched up said "How jQuery Works" and they had this started code when you are using jQuery to set up your html page. Then i went to jQuerys learning center and then i went to using jQuery Core where i would learn more about the jquery keys and commands. With jquery the page can't be manipulated safely until the document is "ready" and jquery can detect whether or not its ready for you. Like for example code inside $( document ).ready(function() will only run once the page DOM is ready for Javascript code to execute. I copied this code into my js bin where it says javascript, also the reason why i chose to do jsbin first is because it find it easier to work there like as my draft so i can see how the code will visual play out and then paste it into my id once i am done.
So then i went to bootstrap and imported the cdn in the stylesheet href. What i did while setting up my home page for my fitness app was creating a div and a button id that the user would click on that says "start-workout".
A resource i used to help me for grouping and to keep the workout data was by going on freecodecamp to the lesson "Accessing Nested Arrays". Another resource i used is W3Schools for certain things like how to make a button interactive for the homepage if they were to like click on start workout or something else.

### Skills
One skill i've developed for this entry is "Problem Decomposition". First i had to create a plan and a vision of how i wanted to make my fitness app/website look. The i needed to figure out how to use my tool jQuery and what specific components will i need to use to help me execute the code for this fitness app. And ofc so i first started off with the html and getbootstrap components to give me the base of the fitness app, then i went to the javascript and jQuery code and then css to top it off so this is how i envisioned in my head the process looking like as i code.
Another skill i learn is called the "Growth Mindest". An example of how i preserved while coding for this project is that even when my peers said jQuery is hard to work with i took it upon myself to try and learn on my own by watching tutorials and going to jQuery and reading the documentations they have and learning the sytnax and all the different types of ajax they have as well as also learning DOM manipulation and this was helpful because i wanted to make my fitness app/site interactive for the user to be able to participate and it modifies the html elements depending on their tag name,or class id. I also searched for jquery code examples because i am a more visual learner so i like to see the code and how its done for myself to get an idea of what to do how to start and placement ideas. I would also set a goal for certian days when im not to busy doing something else for this class or like when i have the most free time to work on this project or whenever i can squeeze in the time and progress through each time.
