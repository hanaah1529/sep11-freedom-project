# Entry 1
##### 11/7/23

The current stage i am on in the engineering and design process is "define the problem". I have decided to create an app called "FitLife" for my freedom project in which will provide workouts you get to pick and choose from in which you think is suitable for you and might also even have descriptions and what this workout is for and a checklist/activitylog to track your workouts. It will also provide some diet plans/healthy meals for you to choose from to recreate on your own. This can be useful for anyone who wants to get into fitness or is already in fitness and wants to live a more helthy lifestyle. The tool i will be using to create this is jQuery and just regular Javascript. Why i choose jQuery is because what its suppose to do is simplify html markup and allows what ever website or app your building to be more interactive.
Some skills i have developed for this entry are "how to google". For example while learning about my tool i searched up things like how to create an app using jQuery on Youtube and a few tutorials would show up and i do this so i can have a good head start and some clear view on how it should be constructed and i needed the extra help. I also would google for some jQuery code concepts for organization because i like to visually see how i would need to structure my code and then think to myself how can i modify ,change, and replace and or add my own input of code. In the jQuery website they have a section of code organization to show users how they should structure their code. This format can be useful because although it may not be easy if you already know basic JS, arrays, functions, and conditionals then you have a place to start.  
Another skill that i have been recently developing more and still am is "How to Learn". For example now i make it upon myself to have to pay more attention in class, do the freecodecamp lessons assigned to me so that it can later on be of help to me when i have to code to make so my freedom project.
