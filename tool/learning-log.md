* Today i am taking the time to learn and get the basics of my tool jQuery. So first my idea was to create something that looks like a fitness app by using the tool jQuery. And to get that fitness app look I used bootstrap components just because it's more useful when doing front-end framework. It is also useful for me because it can help with designing my fitness website to make it look like an app.  I went on youtube and search up jQuery tutorial for beginners and then i ended up finding a better video which was learn to build a jquery mobile app from Scratch so i followed that tutorial instead. So as instructed i copied in the cdn from jQuery mobile and google cdns.
